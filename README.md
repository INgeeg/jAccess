jAccess - jQuery
=======

jAccess Editable-Table is a universal data driven tool whose validation complexity can be implemnted independently  
on server side bases and get back the result to client into the notification box.

This tool is very usefull when there are multiple  table driven projects within one page.

The implementation sample can be taken from jAccess.js file, where the main plugin (jaccess-editable.js) is used to wrap the table. 

It is possible to use multiple tables on same page without any conflicts.

This projects  is open to public and can be modified or be changed with my awareness.
